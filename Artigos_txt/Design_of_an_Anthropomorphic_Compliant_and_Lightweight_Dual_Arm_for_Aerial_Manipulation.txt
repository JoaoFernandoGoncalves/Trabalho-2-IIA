ABSTRACT This paper presents an anthropomorphic, compliant and lightweight dual arm manipulator
designed and developed for aerial manipulation applications with multi-rotor platforms. Each arm provides
four degrees of freedom in a human-like kinematic conguration for end effector positioning: shoulder pitch,
roll and yaw, and elbow pitch. The dual arm, weighting 1.3 kg in total, employs smart servo actuators and
a customized and carefully designed aluminum frame structure manufactured by laser cut. The proposed
design reduces the manufacturing cost as no computer numerical control machined part is used. Mechanical
joint compliance is provided in all the joints, introducing a compact spring-lever transmission mechanism
between the servo shaft and the links, integrating a potentiometer for measuring the deection of the joints.
The servo actuators are partially or fully isolated against impacts and overloads thanks to the ange bearings
attached to the frame structure that support the rotation of the links and the deection of the joints. This simple
mechanism increases the robustness of the arms and safety in the physical interactions between the aerial
robot and the environment. The developed manipulator has been validated through different experiments in
xed base test-bench and in outdoor ight tests.

I. INTRODUCTION
Aerial manipulation proposes the development of ying
robots equipped with one or more [1] robotic arms capable to
perform certain operations in workspaces out of the reach for
humans. This technology is intended to simplify and reduce
the costs associated to inspection and maintenance tasks that
are typical in a wide variety of scenarios in the industry.
Some examples include the detection and repair of leaks in
high altitude pipes in chemical plants, the insulation of cracks
in the blades in wind turbines, the installation and retrieval
of sensor devices in buildings and other structures, or the
measurement of the deection in the metal beams in bridges.
The platforms employed in aerial manipulation are
vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) unmanned aerial
vehicles (UA V) due to the necessity of staying in hover
during the execution of the operation carried out by the
robotic arms. Autonomous helicopters [2], [3] and quadro-
tors [4] have been employed in grasping and transportation
tasks in outdoors. Grasping moving objects [5] and coop-
erative grasping with multiple UA Vs [6] have been alsodemonstrated previously. Two approaches can be identied in
the development of aerial manipulation robots: 1) integrating
a conventional robotic arm designed for ground applications,
or 2), designing a specic manipulator intended to aerial
platform. The rst approach is followed in [2] and [7], where
a 7 degrees of freedom (DOF's) industrial manipulator is
integrated in a helicopter with high payload capacity, or in [4],
where a quadrotor is equipped with a 7-DOF robotic arm
commercially available. Several research prototypes have
been designed for multirotors and tested on ight, with
different number of degrees of freedom, from two up to
seven [8][12]. Aerial manipulators have been applied in a
wide variety of applications, including valve turning with
quadrotors [13], visual servoing [14], contact based inspec-
tion [15], or grasping [16], [17].
Mechanical compliance is a highly desirable feature
for an aerial manipulation robot as it increases safety in
operations involving physical interactions with the environ-
ment [18][20]. The ability of springs and other elastic ele-
ments for absorbing the energy of impacts and overloads at

higher rates than the actuators can provide in a passive way
prevents that contact forces are rigidly propagated through
the manipulator to the aerial platform, destabilizing it. Series
elastic actuators [21] introduce an elastic transmission ele-
ment between the actuator and the output link, allowing the
estimation of the forces based on deection measurement.
This principle can be exploited in low weight robotic arms
built with low cost servos that do not provide any torque con-
trol or feedback capabilities. That is, the joint torque and the
contact forces can be estimated just measuring the deection
of the elastic element [22][24]. Mechanical joint compliance
also protects the gearbox of the servos against peak forces
caused by impacts, the transition from contactless to contact
situations, or overloads caused by motion constraints, for
example in closed kinematic chain congurations. In our
previous work, two research prototypes of human-size, com-
pliant and very low weight robotic arms where developed,
demonstrating their application to soft collision detection and
reaction, payload estimation [25], force torque estimation and
control, and obstacle localization [26].
TABLE 1. Main features of different aerial manipulators.
Bimanual manipulation has been considered in some
recent works, as the valve turning task described in [13],
the grasping and transportation application shown in [27], or
the human-size dual arm aerial manipulator presented in [28].
The main motivation for a dual arm manipulator is to extend
the range of tasks that a ying robot is able perform w.r.t.
a single arm, allowing for example grasping large objects,
manipulating two devices at the same time, or increasing
the maximum lift load. This is done however at expenses of
increasing the payload of the UA V, so the effort now is in
the design of very low weight manipulators [29]. The main
features of several lightweight and compliant manipulators
are compared in TABLE 1.
The main contribution of the paper is the development and
experimental validation of an anthropomorphic, compliant
and lightweight (1.3 kg) dual arm manipulator designed for
aerial manipulation applications. Each arm provides 4 DOF's
for positioning the end effector in a human-like kinematic
conguration. A simple and compact compliant transmission
mechanism is integrated in all the joints with a deection
potentiometer, allowing the estimation and control of the joint
torque and the contact forces. A customized and carefully
designed aluminum frame structure manufactured by laser cut
isolates the servo actuators against impacts and radial-axial
overloads, supporting the rotation of the output links and thespring-lever transmission. The paper details the design and
construction of the arms, covering the kinematics, dynamics,
and the force-torque relationships. Identication experiments
have been conducted for evaluating the impact response and
the frequency behavior. Deection control experiments show
how compliance can be exploited for reducing the interaction
forces between the aerial manipulator and the environment
on ight. The developed dual arm manipulator was inte-
grated in a hexarotor platform, demonstrating bimanual aerial
grasping.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II
introduces some general design considerations related to
aerial manipulation. Section III presents the design of the dual
arm manipulator with its mechanical specications, the kine-
matics and the control architecture. Section IV details the
spring-lever transmission mechanism integrated in the joints,
deriving the force-torque relationships. Section V describes
the structure of the arms, providing the mass and inertia val-
ues. Experimental results validating the design are shown in
Section VI, whereas Section VII summarizes the conclusions
of this work.
II. DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS
A. REQUIREMENTS IN AERIAL MANIPULATION
1) LOW WEIGHT AND INERTIA FEATURES
The rst two parameters that should be determined in the
design of a robotic arm to be integrated in an aerial platform
are its weight and maximum lift load. Let us call PLUAVto
the maximum payload that the UA V is able to lift, and marm
andPLarmto the weight and expected payload that the arm
should lift, respectively. Then, the following equation can be
dened:
marmCPLarmPLUAV (1)
HereD0:7 is the dynamic margin constant that indicates
how far away the brushless motors of the UA V are from
the saturation in normal operation. If the aerial platform is
overloaded ( > 0:8), the propellers may suffer overheating
and they might not respond properly to motion commands.
In order to reduce the inertia of the arms, and thus the
inuence of arms motion over the aerial platform, it results
convenient to place the servos as close as possible to the base
of the aerial platform. Different transmission mechanisms can
be employed for this purpose, including timing belts [10],
pulley-wire [20] or rigid bars [28]. However, these solutions
typically increase the weight of the manipulator, reduce the
range of rotation of the joints, and complicate the design and
assembly of the manipulator.
The mass distribution of the different components
employed in the construction of the arms is represented in
Fig. 1, whereas TABLE 2 indicates the mass density of the
materials.
2) ACTUATORS
The design and development of robotic arms intended to
aerial manipulation is still a hard task due to the multiple
29174 VOLUME 6, 2018
A. Suarez et al.: Design of an Anthropomorphic, Compliant, and Lightweight Dual Arm for Aerial Manipulation
FIGURE 1. Mass distribution (grams and %) of the developed dual arm.
TABLE 2. Materials employed in the lightweight dual arm.
design requirements imposed by the aerial platform in terms
of very low weight, low inertia, mechanical robustness and
dexterity. What is more, there exist important technological
limitations as only a few brands of actuators are suitable for
this purpose. In this sense, the so called smart servos, such
as Herkulex or Dynamixel, are nowadays the best option for
building low weight manipulators [4], [8], [11]. These devices
include the motor, gearbox, electronics, control and commu-
nications in a compact device that can be easily assembled
in a frame structure, providing high torque to weight ratios.
However, the performance of these actuators from the control
point of view is quite limited, as they do not provide any
torque feedback or control, the control rates are usually low
(<100 Hz), and the embedded controller has to be interfaced.
Although the lift load of the arms should be determined by the
application, its value is given in practice by the combination
of servo actuators employed, taking into account that the stall
torque parameter provided by the manufacturer is usually
23 times higher than the maximum dynamic torque that the
servo is able to provide.
3) KINEMATICS
The choice of the kinematic conguration of the arms is
determined in the rst place by the task that the aerial robot is
expected to perform. Almost all aerial manipulators that can
be found on literature consider at least two joints, shoulder
pitch and elbow pitch [8], [9], with the forearm and upper
arm links. Some prototypes exploit the rotation of the UA V
around the yaw angle instead of employing a servo for this
purpose [8]. Other works implement the typical conguration
with three joints for positioning and two [10] or three [11]
DOF's for wrist orientation. Motivated by the convenience
to provide a human-like manipulation capability, this work
follows a bio-inspired design approach, so the kinematics and
size of the human arm are replicated. The idea is that the
application of the arms results more comfortable and intuitivefor a human operator, without requiring special training. The
mechanical construction of this conguration also results in
a compact and robust design, as it will be seen later.
B. COMPONENTS AND MATERIALS
1) FRAME STRUCTURE
Aluminum and carbon ber are widely used for building low
weight robotic arms intended to aerial manipulation due to
their mechanical robustness and low weight. ABS or PLA
plastics should be avoided as they are not impact resistant
and may suffer deformations for temperatures around 40
C. Note that in case of impact, the manipulator will support
the kinetic energy of the whole aerial platform (0.625 J for
a 5 kg weight platform moving at 0.5 m/s). Most aerial
robots employ carbon ber in the frame structure of the arms.
However, the manufacturing cost and the material itself is
quite expensive with respect to aluminum. Besides its low
cost, aluminum is highly malleable, so L-shaped or U-shaped
frames can be easily manufactured bending a at frame. The
possibility of introducing these geometries is important in the
design of the frame structure and its parts.
2) COMPLIANT TRANSMISSION
As mentioned before, one of the main contributions of this
work is the development of a simple, compact and low weigh
spring-lever transmission mechanism integrated in all the
joints of the arms to provide compliance. Conventional steel
springs are preferred rather than other elastic materials like
elastomers due to their high linearity and low hysteresis. The
mechanism makes use of igus ange bearings screwed to
the aluminum frame structure for supporting the rotation of
the output links w.r.t. the servo shafts. These components
provide low friction and vibration dampening, being also
robust against impacts and radial/axial loads.

hexarotor. Take-off/landing (left) and operation (right) configurations.
C. INTEGRATION IN AERIAL PLATFORM
In order to maintain the symmetry of the aerial platform
in terms of geometry and mass distribution, the manipula-
tor is typically installed under the central hub of the UA V,
trying to reduce the displacement of the center of mass
(CoM) with respect to the vertical axis. This implies that the
arms should be placed between the legs of the landing gear,
what may reduce the workspace of the arms due to motion
constraints. The solution adopted in this work is the one
shown in Fig. 2. Thanks to the anthropomorphic kinematic

conguration, the arms can be lifted rotating the shoulder
roll joints, so the upper arm and forearm links are above the
landing gear for UA V take-off and landing. An adaptation
frame consisting of two transversal hollow aluminum proles
is attached to the base of the landing gear. The conguration
of the arms during the take-off and manipulation phases can
be seen in Section VI-D.
FIGURE 3. Phases involved in the design, development and experimental
validation of an aerial manipulation prototype.
D. DEVELOPMENT METHODOLOGY
The development of an aerial manipulation robot involves a
number of phases, graphically represented in Fig. 3. The rst
one is the concept design, which consist of dening the main
specications of the manipulator (payload, size, number of
joints, capabilities), and drawing different designs on paper
to have an idea of its structure. Once a preliminary design
is proposed, the different frame parts are modelled using
3D computer aided design software such as CATIA or Solid
Edge. It is convenient to specify the mass density of all the
components in the model in order to obtain an estimation
of the mass and inertia of the prototype during its design.
It is also necessary to take into account the limitations and
constraints associated to the manufacturing and assembly
processes, as stated in Section II-B. Several iterations may
be necessary in the design until this can be implemented in
the desired way.
Once the prototype is assembled, the next step consists of
integrating the sensors, electronics, and wiring in the frame
structure. The hardware/software architecture, described in
more detail in Section III-C, is the basis for the development
of the different functionalities of the aerial manipulator, such
as position, trajectory, and force control, collision detection
and reaction, teleoperation, or visual servoing for grasping.
All these capabilities must be extensively validated in test-
bench before integrating the manipulator in the aerial vehicle
in order to prevent accidents due to unexpected behaviors,
evaluating the reliability and accuracy through experimental
results.
The installation of the arms in the multirotor requires an
additional frame structure which should be attached at the
landing gear or well at the base of the platform. This structurecan also support the batteries, the computer board, and other
sensors, as the camera. The validation of the aerial robot in
outdoor ight tests requires the participation of at least two
persons: the pilot of the UA V and the operator of the arms.
Security nets and ropes should be used in the rst tests for
preventing potential crashes, especially if the evaluated task
involves contact forces. The position and orientation of the
multirotor, the applied control signals, the angular position
of the actuators and their references should be logged in data
les so the experimental results can be analyzed ofine.

III. ANTHROPOMORPHIC DUAL ARM DESIGN
A. DESCRIPTION
A picture of the developed anthropomorphic, compliant and
lightweight dual arm manipulator can be seen in Fig. 4, with
a detailed view of the right arm construction in Fig. 5. The
dual arm system was designed and developed completely
from scratch, although several design concepts are taken from
our previous work [25], [26], [28]. The actuators used are
the Herkulex DRS-0101 and DRS-0201 smart servos from
Dongbu Robot, introducing the igus EFOM-08 and EFSM-
06 ange bearings in the frame structure for isolating the
servos from impacts and overloads and for building the com-
pliant transmission mechanism. The frame structure of the
arms consists of a set of 34 customized aluminum parts
manufactured by laser cut, two 8 mm Ã shafts for the shoulder

pitch joint, and four 6 mm Ã hollow proles for the upper arm
and forearm links. The laser cut frames include 2 mm, 8 mm
and 10 mm thickness parts. The U-shaped aluminum frames
in the shoulder pitch-yaw and in the elbow pitch structures
(see Section V) are built bending 90 deg the 2 mm thickness
at prole sections. The frame structure has been designed in
such a way that the cost and complexity of the manufacturing
processes is reduced as much as possible.
TABLE 3. Specifications of the compliant dual arm.
TABLE 4. Specifications of the joints of the arms.
The main specications of the dual arm manipulator are
summarized in TABLE 3, providing additional information
relative to each joint of the arms in TABLE 4. The maximum
lift load was obtained placing a payload mass at the grippers
with the arm fully stretched, rotating it from the vertical to the
horizontal position so the torque due to gravity is maximum.
The kinematic conguration, described in more detail in the
following subsection, as well as the dimensions are similar
to the human arm motivated by the convenience of having
human-like manipulation capabilities in an aerial platform.
The shoulder roll joints are used for lifting the arms above
the landing gear before the landing maneuver. Finally, two
Futaba S3003 servos have been employed for building a
simple gripper, integrating a micro switch in the palm for
detecting the contact with the object to grasp.
The developed manipulator satises the following design
requirements imposed in the rst stage of the design process:
1) Low weight and inertia.
2) Mechanical robustness, with high servo protection.
3) Intersection of the four joint axes in a common point,
which simplies the inverse kinematics.4) Integration of compliant transmission mechanism.
5) Integration of deection potentiometers in the joints.
6) Low clearance for increasing the accuracy in the posi-
tioning of the end effector.
All these features contribute to increase the probability of
success in the application of an aerial manipulation robot to
inspection and maintenance tasks in outdoor environments.

reference frames of both arms attached to the shoulder joint.
B. KINEMATICS
1) KINEMATIC CONFIGURATION
The anthropomorphic dual arm provides 4 DOF's for end
effector positioning in a human-like kinematic conguration
with the shoulder pitch joint at the base, followed by the
shoulder roll, shoulder yaw and the elbow pitch joint. The
corresponding joint variables of the output links are denoted
byqi
1,qi
2,qi
3, and qi
4, respectively, with iD1;2 for the left
and right arms. The wrist orientation joints have not been
implemented in this version. A rendered view of the arms with
the parameters of the kinematic model is represented in Fig. 6 ,
including the forearm and upper arm lengths, the separation
between the arms, and the joint angles with the positive direc-
tion of rotation given by the right-hand criteria. A reference
frame Xi

0attached to the intersection point of the joints
of the shoulder of each arm is dened, so the tool center
point (TCP) or any point in the workspace will be referenced
to this frame. Each arm provides one redundant DOF that
can be exploited for collision avoidance, null space control,
or for orienting the end effector. In this work the shoulder
roll angle is considered as a parameter, qi
2D'i, which can
VOLUME 6, 2018 29177

be tuned according to the task. For example, in the take-
off or landing operations, the arms should be in a position
such that the elbow and wrist points are above the landing
gear, so'iD90 degrees, whereas in a visual servoing task,
this angle will take values around 'iD10 degrees.

In order to provide an analytical solution to the inverse kine-

C. ARMS CONTROL BASED IN INVERSE KINEMATICS
A position/velocity controller based on inverse kinematics
has been implemented. The block diagram can be seen in
Fig. 7. In this example, the arms are operated using a 6-DOF
mouse that generates the velocity references, although this
scheme has been also applied to visual servoing. The inverse
kinematics module generates then the joint references taken
as input by the low level arms controller, giving as output the
reference position and play time (PT) sent to the servos.
29178 VOLUME 6, 2018
A. Suarez et al.: Design of an Anthropomorphic, Compliant, and Lightweight Dual Arm for Aerial Manipulation
The proposed scheme exploits the controller embedded in
all the Herkulex smart servos, which generates a trapezoidal
velocity prole for reaching the goal position in the desired
play time. Smooth trajectories can be achieved imposing that
the position references are sent at the midpoint of the velocity
prole.
FIGURE 8. Components and architecture of the compliant dual arm.
D. HARDWARE/SOFTWARE ARCHITECTURE
The architecture of the compliant dual arm manipulator is
depicted in Fig. 8. The components of each arm are the four
Herkulex servos indicated in TABLE 4, the Murata SV 01A
deection potentiometers attached to the joints, and a Futaba
S3003 servo used in the gripper. The servos on each arm
are connected in daisy chain to the Intel NUC board through
an USB-to-USART device. As all the servos share the same
TTL bus, the command/read rate is set to 50 Hz in order
to prevent high packet loss. The analog signals provided by
the deection potentiometers are converted by the Analog to
Digital Converter (ADC) in the STM32VL Discovery micro-
controller board, which also generates the PWM signals that
control the servos of the grippers. The microcontroller board,
programmed in C using the Atollic True Studio IDE, is also
connected to the Intel NUC computer through the USART
interface. The control program executed in this board over
Ubuntu 14.04 was developed in C/C++, making use of the
cmake tool in order to facilitate the portability of the software
project between different computer boards. The higher level
class of the program is the Task Manager, which implements
several tasks or routines that can be selected by the operator
from the Ground Control Station (GCS). The task manager
gathers information from the state of the arms from the
corresponding threads, providing the reference trajectories to
the left/right arm controllers. These modules make use of the
inverse kinematic model described previously for obtaining
the joint references sent to the embedded servo controller
through the USART interface.
IV. COMPLIANT JOINT WITH DEFLECTION FEEDBACK
A. BENEFITS OF MECHANICAL JOINT COMPLIANCE
In most industrial manipulators, the torque is estimated from
the current injected to the motor, or measuring the microdeections of an aluminum structure attached between the
motor shaft and the output link employing strain gauges.
However, current-based torque estimation and control lacks
of accuracy due to the friction of the gearbox, and torque
sensors based on strain gauges require special electronics
and a calibration process which increases the cost of the
devices. What is more, although joint compliance and even
variable stiffness/impedance can be achieved at software level
controlling the torque at high rate (1 KHz), the joint is
intrinsically stiff and therefore less safe than a mechanically
compliant joint in an environment shared with humans.
FIGURE 9. Deflection potentiometer integrated in the shoulder roll (left)
and in the elbow pitch joints (right).
Introducing exible elements like springs or elastomers
for transmitting the motion of the motor to the output link
is a simple and low cost method for providing compliance
at hardware level. These components act as low pass lters,
absorbing the energy of impacts and overloads in a passive
way thanks to their natural dampening. This feature results of
special interest for protecting the servo actuators against peak
torques in those situations in which the manipulator enters
in contact with the environment. A potentiometer or encoder
can be introduced in the compliant joint for building a simple
torque sensor based on the deection of the springs. This
idea was previously introduced in the 3-DOF compliant arm
prototype, demonstrating experimentally its application to
force control in [26]. Fig. 9 shows two compact Murata
SV01A potentiometers integrated in the frame structure of
two joints of the developed dual arm system. A D-shaped
shaft attached to the servo horn is inserted in the hollow shaft
of the potentiometer for measuring the relative rotation of the
output link with respect to the servo shaft.
B. SPRING-LEVER TRANSMISSION MECHANISM
1) MECHANICS
Two of the main requirement imposed in the arms design,
mechanical joint compliance and servo protection, have
been implemented employing the igubal EFOM-08 and
EFSM-06 ange bearings manufactured by igus. These com-
ponents provide excellent features that can be exploited in
the design of low weight robotic arms: low mass density
w.r.t. steel bearings (1.4 g/cm3vs8.5 g/cm3), low friction,
maintenance free, high axial and radial load support, and high
impact and thermal resistance. Also the pivot angle of the ball

to the bending of the aluminum frames. Fig. 10 shows the
EFOM-08 ange bearings installed in the shoulder pitch and
elbow pitch structures. The double ange bearing in side-by-
side conguration provides full isolation of the servo against
axial/radial loads introduced by the crossing shaft. The low
friction and damping of the iglidur W300 plastic allows the
smooth rotation of the shaft.
The spring-lever transmission mechanism consists of a pair
of compression springs that transmit the motion of the servo
shaft to the output link. The L-shaped lever frame is screwed
to the servo horn, pushing the springs that push the T-shaped
transmission frame of the output link. The design parameters
of this mechanism are the lever length and the stiffness of the
springs. The torque-deection characteristic is described in
more detail in [26]. The torsional stiffness of the compliant
joint is obtained in the following way:

This angle is measured by the potentiometer attached at the
frame structure, as depicted in Fig. 9, allowing the estimation
and control of the torque.
2) COMPLIANT JOINT DYNAMICS
The dynamic model of a compliant joint actuator consists of
two parts, the servo-side and the output link-side dynamics,
related through the torque transmitted by the spring-lever
transmission mechanism. Let us consider an arbitrary joint,
omitting the indices for clarity in the notation. If m,f, and
represent the torque generated by the motor, the friction of
the gearbox, and the torque transmitted to the output link, then
the following balance equation can be stablished:
mDbRCfC (13)
where bis the inertia of the rotor. That is, the torque of the
servo motor is spent in accelerating the rotor, compensating
the friction, and pushing the output link. On the other hand,
the output link will be affected by external forces/torques
due to contacts, impacts or motion constraints, the gravity,and by the torque introduced from the compliant transmission
mechanism:
JRqCmgLsin.q/DCext (14)
Here m,J, and Lare the mass, inertia, and length of the
link respectively, whereas gis the gravity constant. Note
that the common term in equations (14)  (15) is the trans-
mitted torque . Taking into account equations (12)  (13),
and the damping due to the friction of the output link shaft
with the ange bearing, the joint torque can be computed as
follows:

where dis the joint damping. This equation shows that the
torque can be estimated from the joint position and veloc-
ity signals provided by the servo and the deection sensor.
It is necessary to remark that most low cost servos only
accept as input position references, but torque estimation
and control can be achieved thanks to the deection of the
springs.
The Herkulex servos were experimentally characterized in
the time and frequency domains, concluding that a rst-order

where TdelayD0:02[s] is the time delay associated to the

3) DUAL ARM MANIPULATOR DYNAMICS
The dynamic model of a compliant joint manipulator can be
expressed in the usual matrix form, obtaining the equations
of motion from the Euler-Lagrange method based on the
Lagrangian and the generalized equation of the forces and
torques. References [30] and [31] can be followed for a more
in detail description of the modeling and control of compliant
joint manipulators.
As in the single joint case, the equations of the dynamic
model of a compliant joint arm can be divided into two parts.
Firstly, the servo-side dynamics includes the torque of the
motor, the friction of the gearbox, the torque transmitted by
the spring-lever mechanism, and the inertia of the rotor:

C. AERIAL MANIPULATOR DYNAMICS
The derivation of the complete dynamic model of a dual arm
aerial manipulator is out of the scope of this work, although
previous research in dual arm space manipulators [32] and
underwater manipulators [33] are suggested. In our previous
work [28] we developed the equations of the Euler-Lagrange
formulation for a stiff-joint dual arm aerial robot, expressed
in the usual matrix form with the inertia, Coriolis and gravity
terms. In the case of the compliant manipulator described in
this paper, the vector of generalized coordinates 2R22
includes both the servo and the output link angular position
vectors, as well as the UA V position and attitude vectors, r
and2R3, respectively:
Dh

The vector of generalized forces 02R22includes the
forces and torques acting over the aerial platform, FUAVand

external torque i

where KandVare the kinetic and potential energy of the
system, respectively. Note that the potential energy includes
two terms, the gravitational potential and the elastic potential
energy associated to the exible joints, which depends on the
joint stiffness and the deection angle. After some work, it is
possible to express the model in the following matrix form:

where M2R2222is the generalized inertia matrix, C2
R22represents the centrifugal and Coriolis terms, G2R22
is the gravity component of the wrenches, whereas Kand
D2R22are the components associated to the deection and
the friction of the compliant joints. According to the notation,
all these terms depend on the generalized coordinate vec-
tor, or well on a specic group of coordinates. The position
of the manipulator relative to the base of the aerial platform
and the angular position of the links modies the value of
the inertia matrix and the thrust that the propellers should
deliver to compensate the torque due to gravity when thecenter of mass is displaced. In general, it is convenient that the
manipulator is as close as possible to the geometric center of
the UA V, maintaining the symmetry in the mass distribution,
although from the theoretical point of view, the particular
location of the arms does not affect the model.

relationships.
D. FORCE-TORQUE RELATIONS
1) GEOMETRIC INTERPRETATION
In many manipulation operations it is necessary to estimate
and control the contact forces at the end effector. This can be
done measuring the deection of the joints and applying the
force-torque relations. These can be obtained in two steps: 1)
compute the torque vector i
jDFi
jri
jfor all the joints, that
is, the cross product between the force acting over the link
of the joint and its position, and 2) project the torque on the
corresponding joint axis. The matrix representation is then
obtained. Let consider the diagram shown in Fig. 11, where
S,EandWare the shoulder, elbow and wrist points referred
to frame 0iattached to the shoulder joint. These points, whose
position vectors are rsD0,reandrw, dene the SEW
plane and the normal vector nsew. The elbow and wrist points
are obtained from the forward kinematic model. From now
on, superscript iis omitted for clarity in the notation. The
normalized position vectors shoulder-elbow and elbow-wrist
are denoted by useanduew, and are dened as follows:
useDre
krek(24)
uewDrw re
krw rek(25)
The normal vector to the SEW plane can be computed as:
nsewDuseuew
kuseuewk(26)
It will be assumed that the contact force Fis applied at the
wrist point. The torque supported by the elbow pitch and the
shoulder yaw joints is rstly obtained from the vector:
ewDF.rw re/ (27)
VOLUME 6, 2018 29181
A. Suarez et al.: Design of an Anthropomorphic, Compliant, and Lightweight Dual Arm for Aerial Manipulation
Now, the projection of this torque vector in the direction
of the rotation axis of each joint provides the corresponding
joint torque. In the case of the elbow joint, the direction of
rotation is parallel to nsewand thus:
4DnT
sewew (28)
The axis of rotation of the shoulder yaw joint is use, so:
3DuT
seew (29)
The torque in the shoulder roll and pitch joints is obtained
in a similar way, considering the shoulder-to-wrist vector and
the direction of rotation of these joints:
swDFr w (30)
2D[cosq1;0;sinq1]sw (31)
1D[0;1;s0]sw (32)
Equations (28)  (32) can be rewritten in matrix form,
in such a way that the torque-force relation is linear. This is
done expressing the cross product as matrix multiplication
using a skew-symmetric matrix dened as follows:
FrDF2
4rx
ry
rz3
5D2
40 rzry
rz0 rx
 ryrx03
5FDAF
(33)
2) JACOBIAN-BASED INTERPRETATION
The force at the end effector can be computed from the joint
torque and the Jacobian of the manipulator. Assuming that
the contact force control task is executed in static or close to
static conditions, the torque can be computed easily from the
joint deection and the joint stiffness matrix (neglecting the
damping), so the force vector in task space will be given by:
FiD
Ji;T 1
iD
Ji;T 1
Ki1i(34)
Here Ji2R34is the Jacobian of the i-th manipulator, and
KiDdiag(ki
j)2R44is the corresponding joint stiffness
matrix.
3) CARTESIAN DEFLECTION
It is interesting to note that, if qiis replaced by iin Equa-
tion (3), then FKi(i) would represent the forward kinemat-
ics of an equivalent stiff joint manipulator. The difference
between the position of the TCP in this virtual manipulator
and in the compliant arm is dened as the Cartesian deec-
tion,1li:
1liDFKi(i) FKi

(35)
The Cartesian deection represents the deviation in the
position of the TCP due to the deection of the compliant
joints. This concept is useful if, for example, a camera head
gives the 3D position of a marker attached at the end effector,
as it would allow the estimation and control of contact forces
directly in the task space, increasing at the same time the

In static conditions, the contact force will be proportional to

According to this equation, the Cartesian stiffness will vary
with the position of the joints. In particular, innite stiffness
is associated to the kinematic singularities of the arms.

V. ARMS FRAME STRUCTURE
This section details the construction of the different links of
the arms, providing the mass and inertia parameters obtained
from the CAD model, which are summarized in Fig. 13 and

CoM of each structure is shown in the gures below. This

section does not consider the mass and inertia of the spring-
lever transmission frames as these parameters are negligible
w.r.t. the corresponding output links.
FIGURE 14. CoM and dimensions (in mm) of the shoulder pitch structure.
A. SHOULDER PITCH STRUCTURE
This structure provides full protection to the Herkulex DRS-
0201 servo. The radial and axial loads are supported by the
igubal EFOM-08 ange bearings installed in side-by-side
conguration, allowing the rotation of the shaft that connects
the shoulder roll structure with the compliant transmission
mechanism of the shoulder pitch joint. These components
also provide vibration dampening and smooth rotation of the
shaft. Fig. 14 shows a rendered view of this structure along
with the XYZ axes to which the inertia moments are referred,
as well as the dimensions in mm. The structure is built from
two U-shaped aluminum parts manufactured by laser cut,
2 mm thickness and 25 mm width. The space left between the
servo horn and the inner ange bearing (21 mm) is allocated
for installing the spring lever mechanism and the deection
potentiometer. The assembly of the spring lever mechanism
and the shoulder roll structure can be seen in Fig. 10.
B. SHOULDER ROLL STRUCTURE
This structure, whose rendered view is depicted in Fig. 15,
provides partial protection to the Herkulex DRS-0201 servo
through an igubal EFOM-08 ange bearing installed over
the aluminum support frame on the back of the actuator.
The shoulder yaw structure, described in next sub-section,
is supported by this ange bearing and by the servo horn. The
8 mm Ã shaft crosses the EFOM-08 pair at the shoulder pitch
structure, connecting the shoulder pitch transmission with the

shoulder roll support frame. The shaft ts in a T-shaped frame
in such a way that there is no clearance causing a dead-zone
at the end effector.
FIGURE 16. CoM and dimensions (in mm) of the shoulder roll structure.
C. SHOULDER YAW STRUCTURE
A pair of igubal EFSM-06 ange bearings screwed into the
base of a U-shaped frame support the rotation of the upper
arm link and the compliant transmission. A third component
attached to the inner side of the frame allows the rotation of
this structure around the shoulder roll shaft, whereas the 8 mm
Ã shaft in the opposite side is inserted in the EFOM-08 ange
bearing of the shoulder roll structure. A rendered view of the
assembly and the dimensions can be seen in Fig. 16.
FIGURE 17. CoM and dimensions (in mm) of the shoulder roll structure.
D. UPPER ARM LINK
This assembly, shown in Fig. 17, is similar to the shoulder
roll structure, although in this case the transmission frame on

the right of the 6 mm Ã prole is rotated 90 deg with respect
to the servo support frame. This shaft passes through the pair
of EFSM-06 ange bearings of the shoulder yaw structure.
This solution, in which the elbow pitch servo is placed at the
elbow joint, is not convenient in terms of inertia, but it avoids
introducing a transmission mechanism, reducing the weight
and complexity in the design and the assembly.
FIGURE 18. CoM and dimensions (in mm) of the forearm structure.
E. FOREARM LINK
The forearm link consists of a 6 mm Ã link connected to
the elbow joint through a U-shaped frame and a pair of
EFSM-06 ange bearings in side-by-side conguration.
A rendered view of the assembly is represented in Fig. 18.
The EFOM-08 ange bearing is inserted into the servo shaft,
asFig. 9 shows, using a M3 screw on the opposite side as sec-
ond support point in the elbow pitch base frame. Although
the current version does not implement the wrist orientation
mechanism, the EFSM-06 pair allows the rotation of the end
effector around the axis dened by the forearm link (wrist roll
angle).
VI. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
This section presents experimental results for characterizing
and validating the developed anthropomorphic, compliant
and lightweight dual arm manipulator. The resonance fre-
quencies of the compliant joints are identied, showing the
response to impacts against the end effector. Zero deection
control in grabbing situations and bimanual object grasping
experiments have been also conducted. For clarity in the
evaluation of the concepts of interest, the graphical results
correspond to xed base experiments, as the conditions for
the outdoor ight tests are less controllable. Finally, bimanual
grasping on ight has been demonstrated in outdoors.
A. FREQUENCY ANALYSIS
Each individual compliant joint can be assimilated to a mass-
spring-damper system characterized by its natural frequency.
In a compliant joint manipulator, the distribution of the mass
will vary with the position of the joints, and so the resonance
frequencies. Furthermore, the deection of one joint may
excite another joints due to dynamic coupling. The goal of
this experiment is identifying these behaviors in the dual
arm manipulator, introducing a chirp (or sweep) signal in the
FIGURE 19. Elbow pitch (blue) and shoulder pitch (green) joint deflection
for a 15 deg chirp signal generated by the elbow pitch servo (black).
elbow joint for this purpose. The elbow servo will generate
a 15 deg amplitude oscillation, increasing the frequency lin-
early with the time from 0 up to 8 Hz in 60 seconds:
1;2
4;ref.t/D1;2
4;offsetC15sin8t2
60
(38)
Two representative congurations for the dual arm are
considered depending on the offset angle of the elbow: arms
fully stretched (1;2
4;offsetD0deg), and L-shaped exion of
the elbow (1;2
4;offsetD90deg.) Fig. 19 shows the evolution of
the elbow pitch servo position along with the elbow pitch and
the shoulder pitch deection signals. No ltering was applied
to these signals. As it can be seen, two resonance modes are
identied in tD12sand in tD45s. The rst one is coupled
to the shoulder pitch joint, whereas the second one mainly
affects to the elbow joint. It is interesting to note that, at the
resonance frequency of the rst mode, the relative phase of
the elbow pitch deection signal drops 180 deg with respect
to the servo position. This can be appreciated more clearly in
Fig. 20. As the amplitude of the servo rotation is similar to the
joint deection but with different sign, the apparent effect is
that the forearm link is not oscillating, which is conrmed by
visual inspection of the experiment.
The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm was applied to
the signals depicted in Fig. 19 for obtaining a frequency rep-
resentation of the servo bandwidth and the resonance peaks
of the compliant joints. These can be identied clearly in
Fig. 21. The rst resonance mode (f 1D1:624 Hz) affects to
the elbow pitch and shoulder pitch joints, whereas the second
mode (f 2D5:92 Hz) only affects to the elbow joint and it has
a wider bandwidth than the rst one. The servo actuator is not
able to follow the chirp reference from fD1:5Hz due to its
limitations in speed and torque.
The variation in the frequency response of the compliant
arm due to the rotation of the elbow joint is evidenced in
Fig. 22. In this case, as the distance from the center of mass of
the arm to the shoulder joint is lower, the resonance frequency

FIGURE 20. Detailed view of the servo position and the joints deflection.
Before the first resonance peak the deflection is in phase with the servo
(up), dropping 180 deg in the second resonance peak (down).
FIGURE 21. FFT applied to the elbow pitch servo (black) and to the elbow
pitch (blue) and shoulder pitch (green) joint deflection. The resonance
frequencies are identified at f1D1:6Hzandf2D5:9Hz.
increases, varying from f1D1:624 Hztof1D2:075 Hz. The
amplitude of the second resonance mode is also higher due to
the effect of gravity over the forearm link mass.
The identication of the resonance frequencies is useful for
anticipating and preventing undesired behaviors of the aerial
manipulator on ight, as these modes may be excited due to
the dynamic coupling with the aerial platform or the control
loop. Also the value of the joint damping can be determined
experimentally from these gures, known the joint stiffness
(TABLE 4) and link inertia (CAD model) parameters.
B. IMPACT RESPONSE
This experiment shows the response of the compliant joints
when the end effector suffers the impact of a 62 g weight
object thrown from a height of 57 cm, which corresponds to
FIGURE 22. FFT applied to the elbow pitch servo (black), the elbow pitch
(blue) and shoulder pitch (green) joint deflection. The spectrum and
resonance frequencies have changed along with the mass of the arm.

a potential energy of 0.35 J. The setup consisted of a drylin
T rail guide system TS-04-15 installed in vertical position,
and a TW-04-15 carriage manufactured by igus Rthat slides
along the rail. An accelerometer was attached under the end
effector of the left arm (see Fig. 4), where the carriage will
impact. Fig. 23 represents the acceleration at this point and
the deection of the elbow pitch and shoulder pitch joints
in two consecutive impacts. The reference position for these
joints were1
1D0 and1
4D 90 deg. Note that the springs
in the compliant joints act as low-pass lters, so the high
frequency component of the energy generated by the impact
is attenuated thanks to the natural damping of the springs
and the bearing. This prevents that the shaft of the servos
are damaged due to peak forces associated to the transition

from contactless to contact situations, improving the safety
and robustness of the manipulator during the realization of
tasks involving physical interaction with the environment.
C. ZERO DEFLECTION CONTROL IN CLOSED
KINEMATIC CHAIN
Let us consider an operation in which the aerial manipulator
has to grab a long bar using both arms. The bar is left on a
bench in such a way that it is necessary to pull it upwards for
retrieving it while the aerial platform is hovering in a xed
position above the bench. The motion constraints associated
to grabbing situations may generate undesired forces that,
when exerted over the aerial platform, will cause positioning
drifts or even crashes if the UA V controller is not able to
deal with them. What is more, the actuators in a stiff joint
manipulator might be damaged if there is no torque feedback
available to detect and compensate joint overloads. In order
to reduce the inuence of contact forces during grabbing
phases, this work proposes a simple method that exploits the
joint deection in the developed manipulator. The idea is to
implement a joint deection controller that tries to maintain
a zero deection reference, or what is the same, a zero joint
torque. With that, the manipulator will be able to compensate
position deviations without disturbing the platform.
In this experiment, a low weight plastic box representing
an inspection tool is grasped from a 35 cm length horizontal
handle using both arms, forming a closed kinematic chain.
A calibration process is previously executed for obtaining
the voltage offset of the deection potentiometers. After that,
the zero deection controller is enabled. A simple propor-
tional controller provides the incremental joint position of the
servos using the deection feedback:
i
j;refDi
jCKp1i
j (39)
Here Kpis the proportional gain. When the grasped object
is pulled or pushed by hand, the external force will cause the
deection of the joints. However, the elastic potential energy
stored in the springs will be actively released by the servos,
in such a way that the deection will tend to zero. Fig. 24
andFig. 25 represent the Cartesian position and the joint
deection of both arms when the object is guided following
an elliptical trajectory over the XZ plane. Fig. 26 shows the
same signals when the object is guided in the X, Y and Z
axes separately, which allows to identify the involved joints
on each axis more clearly.
D. BIMANUAL GRASPING: OUTDOOR FLIGHTS
Outdoor ight tests were conducted for validating the dual
arm design, demonstrating the bimanual grasping capability.
The arms were integrated in a DJI Matrice 600 hexarotor for
this purpose along with an Intel NUC computer board, a ZED
stereo camera for visual servoing, a 5.8 GHz wireless link,
and the batteries. The experiment consisted of six phases: 1)
take off, 2) approach to the inspection tool installed on a PVC
pipe, 3) move the arms to the operation position, 4) activate
visual servoing, 5) retrieve the inspection tool, and 6) release

the tool. The setup and the execution of the experiment are
represented in Fig. 27 andFig. 28.
The UA V was radio-controlled in position by an expert
human pilot while an operator took care of the arms from a
ground control station (GCS). The tests were conducted in a
664 meters area covered by a safety net. The purpose
of the developed scenario was illustrating the application of
dual arm aerial manipulators to installation and retrieval of
inspection tools deployed in areas of difcult access such as
high altitude pipes in chemical plants.
The grasping method consisted of guiding the TCP of the
left and right arms from their initial position to the grasping
points applying the control method shown in Fig. 7, closing
the grippers when the goal point is reached. The grasping
points provided to the arms controller are obtained from the
vision algorithm described in [34]. A ZED stereo camera
attached to the shoulder structure was employed due to its
wide eld of view and high image quality. Fig. 29 shows

the grasping points given by the vision module during the
ight experiment. Positioning errors are mainly due to non-
compensated joint deections and to misalignment errors
between the arms frame and the camera frame. The control
period and velocity were set to TD0:1s, and the reference
velocity of the arms was set to vD0:2m=s.
The analysis of the video of the outdoor ight tests reveal
that the inuence of arms motion over the attitude controller
in contactless situations is almost negligible, since the mass

and inertia of the manipulator is very low compared to the
mass of the multirotor. In [28] we proposed a method for
estimating and compensating the reaction torques induced by
a stiff-joint dual arm over the base of the aerial platform,
identifying separately the gravity, Coriolis, and inertia terms.
The torque due to gravity is associated to variations in the
position of the end effector, and it is more evident when an
object is grasped and lifted, although it is typically cancelled
by the integral term of the attitude controller. The effect of
the other two dynamic terms can be limited simply adjusting
the maximum joint/Cartesian speed of the arms, at expenses
of reducing the time performance.
VII. CONCLUSION
This paper detailed the design and mechanical construction of
an anthropomorphic, compliant and ultra-lightweight (1.3 kg)
dual arm manipulator developed for its integration in a

multi-rotor platform. Both left and right arms provide 4-DOF
for end effector positioning in a human-like kinematic cong-
uration. The robust aluminum frame structure and the use of
a simple and compact spring-lever transmission mechanism
introduced in all the joints provide a high level of protection to
the servo actuators against impacts and joint overloads. This
features is highly convenient for reducing the cost and time
associated to repairs, as the servo actuators represent around
the 70% of the cost in materials of the manipulator. One of
the main conclusions derived from the experiments is that
the capacity of the compliant joints to support impacts and
joint overloads associated to motion constraints increases the
probability of success in a grasping task with respect to a
stiff joint manipulator. The mechanical tolerance of the joints
also results extremely useful for the realization of several
tasks involving the cooperation of both arms, as bimanual
grasping, without requiring a highly accurate coordination of
the arms. As future work, it would be necessary to evaluate
the accuracy and reliability of the force-torque estimation
method.
