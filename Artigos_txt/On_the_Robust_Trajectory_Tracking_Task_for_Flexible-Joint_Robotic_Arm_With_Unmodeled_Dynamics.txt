ABSTRACT This paper is concerned with the design and experimental assessment of, both, feedback
linearization and sliding mode control techniques to the tracking trajectory problem of a exible-joint robotic
arm for a smooth rest to rest maneuver. The robust improvement of these controllers is analyzed by means
of additional integral compensation, in which an alternative sliding surface was proposed for the control of
the exible arm. A feedback linearization of the nonlinear dynamic equation of the robot arm is computed
in order to get a full-state non-linear feedback control law. On the other hand, it is proposed a second order
sliding mode control with an integral term in the sliding surface, which improves the robustness of the
controller sliding surface. Some experimental evaluations that include the addition of external unmodeled
perturbations to test the enhancement of the robustness property show the improvements and effectiveness of
the proposed control laws in disturbance rejection tasks. The controllers were implemented using exclusively
position measurements and time derivatives approximations.

I. INTRODUCTION
The control of exible manipulators has been studied with
great interest by, both, practical engineers as well as academic
researchers. This is mainly because the application of control
algorithms for rigid joint robotic manipulators is limited, and
their direct application may lead to poor results. The nature of
exible joint systems is generated by pulleys, timing belts or
harmonic drives causing a exible joint phenomenon. On the
other hand, the exible link model effect can be arisen by
increasing payload-to-weight ratio, motion speed or control
bandwidth, see [34]. In both cases, this class of systems
increases its order, as well as, the difculties to control its
end-position.
Some natural benets of exible joints include:
Arising of mechanical impedance [44]. This aspect is
helpful is human robot interaction tasks [42]. Also it
provides protection of the mechanisms against impacts
and torque reduction in the actuators.
The exibility allows a mechanical energy storage,
which is helpful in a wide class of applications(orthosis, prosthetic devices, exible manipulators, etc)
and semi active systems (structural damping systems,
among others) [12], [19].
Some control approaches have been proposed for the sta-
bilization and trajectory tracking control of exible joints.
For instance, robust control schemes [10], [14], [16], [18],
[24], [30], adaptive control [9], [21], [35], backstepping [3],
passivity based control [33], recursive methods [45],
extended state observers [37], saturated control [4], among
others. All these control schemes are based on nonlinear
control strategies that can be applied to highly nonlinear
dynamic systems. These nonlinear approaches may not pro-
vide robustness for controlling exible robotic manipulators,
mainly since most of them require the complete knowledge
of the mathematical model or, at least, an approximate one.
To overcome this restriction, fuzzy controllers [11], [22], [38]
have been developed because its structure is rather simple
in comparison with other model-based controllers. However,
fuzzy control usually takes up a considerable computation
time, the gain tuning may be exhausting, and it needs to be

simplied [13]. In other cases, hybrid control laws have been
developed considering the combination of fuzzy and H1
control [28], fuzzy logic and discontinuous control tech-
niques [23], fuzzy logic and neural networks [36], in order to
reject oscillations and achieve a good tracking performance.
Generally, a exible-joint robot cannot be linearized by
static feedback [39]. However, an alternative simplied
model was provided that, under some assumptions, it can be
feedback linearizable [34]. In [8], it was proven that the whole
class of elastic joint robots can be linearized via dynamic
feedback. In [7], [27], [29], some feedback linearization con-
trollers are presented.
On the other hand, the sliding mode control method [40],
can compensate uncertainties in the dynamic parameters of
the robot arm as well as disturbance inputs. The basic idea
behind the sliding mode control is to apply a discontinuous
feedback control law in order to drive the system, in a nite
time, to a desire surface, called sliding surface , in the state
space. Some examples of sliding mode controllers in exible
joint arms are found in [6], [17], [26], [43] and the refer-
ences therein. In general, the sliding surface depends on the
phase state of the system achieving good results. However,
an appropriate sliding surface extending the phase state of
the system using integral terms can improve the robustness
response of the closed loop system in practical applications
which are prone to be subject to disturbance inputs. This
idea has been comprehensively developed in classic control
schemes such as PD/PID, with a less specialized theoretical
knowledge and taken in alternative control schemes where
integral compensation terms have been used to reject a wider
class of disturbance inputs [46].
In this contribution the tracking problem of a Flexible-Joint
Robotic Arm for a smooth rest to rest maneuver avoiding
undesirable oscillations is addressed by means of two control
approaches with additional integral terms, one for a classic
feedback linearization and another one in the case of the
surface of a high order sliding mode controller. To design
the control law via feedback linearization, it is followed the
scheme presented in [15] based on an appropriate coordinate
transformation to turn the given dynamics into a linear and
controllable system. In this case, in contrast with most of the
existing works, the output function is given in terms of the
addition of two angular positions. In the case of the sliding
mode control, it is dened a variation of the sliding surface
in the Super Twisting control approach, by adding an integral
term (see [41]) which guarantees a stabilizing sliding mode
control, while increasing the robustness with respect to the
nonlinearities in the state space description as well as external
disturbance inputs.
The manuscript is organized as follows: Section II the
dynamic model of the exible joint robot arm under study
and the problem formulation are presented. The design of the
proposed non-linear control laws is developed in Section III.
Section IV shows the experimental results of the proposed
control laws. A classical PID, is taken as a starting point
for the controllers analysis behavior and the same schemeswithout the integral compensation are included to show the
improvement of the presented proposal. Concluding remarks
end this contribution.

In this contribution a single Flexible Joint Robotic system, as
shown in Figure 1, is analyzed. The following parameters and
variables are considered
1Angular position of the rotating base

The angular position of the arm tip is dened by the
relation

In order to determine the dynamic model of the exible-
joint robot, the Euler-Lagrange approach was followed. The
Lagrangian of the system is
LDK V
where Krepresents the kinetic energy and Vthe potential
energy.
The kinetic energy of the system is given by
KDKbCKa
where Kbrepresents the kinetic energy of the rotating base,
andKarepresents the kinetic energy of the arm.
The potential energy of the system satises the relation
VDVsCVa
where Vsis the potential energy associated to the spring,
andVais the potential energy associated with the arm.

It is desired to move the main arm end-point from an initial
rest angular position y(0)D1(0)C2(0) to a nal rest
angular position, y(T), within the time interval [0 ;T], while
following a pre-specied trajectory y(t) dened as a smooth
rest to rest maneuver, by means of interpolation of B√©zier type
polynomials. It is desirable that the angular position of the
link tip arrives to its nal destination without oscillations in
spite of disturbances, non modelled nonlinearities or external
perturbations.

A. ROBUST FEEDBACK LINEARIZATION CONTROLLER
To determine the control law via feedback linearization, we
follow the scheme presented in [15]. In this case, the follow-
ing output function is proposed
h(x)Dx1Cx3
The rst step in this strategy, is to determine the relative
degree of the system, and in order to determine it, we must
rst compute the derivative of the output function, dened as
Ph(x)D@h(x)
@xPxDLfh(x)CLgh(x)
where Lfh(x) and Lgh(x) denote the Lie derivative of the out-
put function h(x), with respect to f(x) and g(x) respectively.
Then
Lfh(x)Dx2Cx4
Lgh(x)D0
therefore, the higher order time derivatives are expressed as
Rh(x)DL2
fh(x)CV(t)LgLfh(x)
h(3)(x)DL3
fh(x)CV(t)LgL2
fh(x)
h(4)(x)DL4
fh(x)CV(t)LgL3

Since LgL3

is four.

B. ROBUST SUPER-TWISTING SLIDING MODE CONTROL
The classical rst order sliding mode control methodology
is a discontinuous robust feedback technique, whose main
disadvantage, is the appearance of chattering [5], [31], which
may rise due to neglected fast dynamics or to digital imple-
mentation issues [40]. This phenomenon is characterized
by high frequency oscillations at the output system that
can be harmful when the controller is applied in motion
control systems. In order to reduce this phenomenon and
reject perturbations, a higher order sliding mode control is
proposed [1], [20]. First of all, the following sliding manifold
is proposed

IV. PROTOTYPE ARCHITECTURE AND
EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
In this section the instrumentation and set up of the
Flexible-Joint Robotic Arm prototype are presented.
The designed control laws were, both, implemented in
Matlab-Simulink through a Data Acquisition device. Some
rest to rest tracking results by using a classic controller, as
well as the proposed schemes are also presented to illustrate
the effectiveness of the proposals.
A. IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CONTROLLER PLATFORM
Figure 2 shows the diagram of the experimental platform used
to control the Flexible-Joint Robotic Arm system.
FIGURE 2. Block diagram for the Flexible-Joint Robotic Arm control
scheme.
The experimental device is shown in Figure 3. It consists
of a DC motor NISCA: model NC5475, which drives a
rotating base through a synchronous belt and pulley system
with a 16:1 ratio. The main arm is attached to the rotating
base by two identical springs, resulting in a exible joint.
Both, the angular positions of the rotating base and the
arm were measured with incremental optical encoders of
1000 pulses/revolution. The data acquisition is carried out
through a data card Sensoray model 626. This board, is
responsible to read the signals from the optical incremental
encoders and supplies control voltages to the power ampli-
ers. The control strategies were implemented in the
FIGURE 3. Flexible-Joint Robot Arm system prototype.
Matlab-Simulink environment, and the devised control sig-
nals were transferred to the actuators through three power
ampliers Sanyo, model STK4050II. Finally, the sampling
time was set to be 0.001[s]. The Flexible-Joint Robot
Arm parameters, used to implement the control laws are:
lD0:5[m], mD0:1633[Kg], JaD0:0136[Kg-m2],
JbD0:002405[Kg-m2],ksD4[N-m/rad] and ND16,
while the motor parameters are: kD0:0724[N-m/A] and
RmD2:983 [].
B. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
1) TRACKING TRAJECTORY PROBLEM FORMULATION
The considered set of initial conditions for the system are:
[1(0)D0;2(0)D0]. The desired trajectory that the
Flexible-Joint Arm Robot must achieve is dened as follows:
the path is initialized at y(0)D0[rad] at time tD0[s],
then when tD2[s] the mechanism is moved, in an inter-
val of 0:6[s], to y(t)D
2[rad], the trajectory remains in
this position for 7 :4[s]. Finally, when time reach 10[s], the
reference trajectory returns to y(t)D0[rad], in a interval
of time 0:6[s], and the device stays in this position until
the experiment ends. This trajectory takes 18 seconds to be
completed and it will be used throughout the experimental
tests.
2) PID CONTROLLER
In order to show the inevitably oscillations induced at the
end-effector due to the exibility of the manipulator. We
propose a traditional PID controller for the position of the
rotating base 1regardless the position of the arm 2, where
the desired rest to rest trajectory for the rotating base position
is specied as 

FIGURE 5. The rotating base trajectory tracking.
Figure 4 shows the Flexible-Joint Robot Arm experimental
platform performance. While, the rotating base follows the
desired trajectory y(t) (see, Figure 5), the link tip presents
undesirable oscillations when the rotating base accomplish
the rest positions, which occurs at tD2:6[s] and tD10:6[s].
In Figure 6, the tracking error eyPID(t)DyPID(t) y(t) is
depicted. As we can see, the maximum amplitude of eyPID(t)
is approximately 0 :6[rad] and it decrease exponentially with
a frequency of oscillation fD2:75[Hz]. The effects of the
gravity affecting the system can be clearly appreciated when
the rotating base arrive to reference y(2:6)D
2[rad], as
a consequence of this effects, an offset of 0 :1[rad] appears
on the position of the link tip with respect to the tracking
reference.
The control voltage applied to the motor VPID(t) is depicted
in Figure 7. Here, we can notice that when the oscillations

occur, they affect the angular position of the base 1PID(t), and
as it was shown in Figure 5, the controller tries to compensate
the dynamics produced by the oscillations.
3) FEEDBACK LINEALIZATION CONTROLLER
The oscillations due to the exibility of the system, makes
it difcult to control the position of end-point in an effec-
tive manner. In order to achieve the suppression of oscilla-
tions, we use an exact feedback linearization controller (FL),
of the form (7) and a integral feedback linearization
controller (IFL), developed in Section III-A. The FL con-
troller design parameters (9) were specied using the values
FLD1:4,!FLD45, and IFL controller parameters were
choose asIFLD2:5,!IFLD30 and pIFLD20. The
output is dened as the angular position of end-point of arm,
that is yFL(t) and yIFL(t) for both controllers are shown in
Figure 8. It becomes evident the suitable tracking quality
of the schemes, the arm's end-point position carry out the
trajectory tracking task without oscillations.
The tracking error eyFLandeyIFLof the system are shown
in Figure 9, where can observe, that the position error is
restricted to a small vicinity and it is seen to be uniformly
bounded, in the steady state, and it is smaller in comparison to
eyPID(see, Figure 6). The control voltage VFL(t) and VIFL(t)

is depicted in Figure 10. In contrast of the PID control voltage,
here the peak voltage is smaller and cancel out the undesirable
oscillations.
4) SUPER-TWISTING SLIDING MODE CONTROLLER
In order to test the performance of the feedback linearization
scheme, we carried out a comparative analysis with respect
to a super twisting sliding mode controller (SM) and integral

super twisting sliding mode controller (ISM) that is a well-
known robust control scheme. Taking advantage of feedback
linearization, the implementation of a sliding mode based
control scheme is feasible, see [32]. The design parame-
ters (11) of the SM controller were chosen according the
valuesSMD1:4,!SMD25 and pSMD20,WD2789600,
aD7000,D100. The parameters for ISM (15) were
set using the following values ISMD1:5,!SMD20 and
WD2789600, aD7000,D100. The output is specied
as the angular position of end-point of arm as ySM(t) and
yISM(t) are shown in Figure 11. We can notice the accept-
able performance in the tracking trajectory task, avoiding
oscillations and reducing the tracking error when the link tip
arrive to the rest positions in comparison with yFLandyIFL
tracking trajectory. The tracking error eySM(t) and eySM(t) are
detailed in Figure 12. It is restricted to a vicinity of radius
0.1 [rad] approximately, and in comparison of the error in the
Feedback linearization scheme eyFL(t) and eyIFL(t), are sig-
nicantly smaller. The control voltages VSLM(t) and VISM(t)
are provided in Figure 13 which tend to cancel out the additive
endogenous disturbance inputs produced by dynamic of the
system, dened in (13), and the controllers show a minimal
chattering during all the operation. Chattering is undesirable

C. EXTERNAL PERTURBATION TEST
The controllers proposed have a good performance using
a total knowledge of dynamic model of the exible robot
link, In order to test the controller robustness in presence
of an external un-modeled perturbation, we add arm a pen-
dulum actuated by a RC servomotor as show Figure 15,
pendulum length is lpD0:20[m] with a mass on the
top of mpD0:050[Kg], the RC servomotor mass is
msD0:050[Kg]. The initial condition of pendulum is 0[rad],

tion for 4 seconds, when the time is tD8[s] the pendulum
returns to initial condition, we use the same gains computed
for unperturbed test.

The perturbed angular position end-point arm using feed-

of external perturbation respect of FL, the control input VIFL

minimal error. Integral Feedback linearization and Integral
second order slide mode control avoid oscillations and are
robust in a presence of external un-modeled perturbations. It
can be also observed in Figure 22 where a minimal perfor-
mance index is achieved by ISIISM(t) and ISIIFL(t), compared
with the results obtained with the ISIFL(t), and ISISM(t) based
controllers.

V. CONCLUSIONS
In this work, the tracking control problem of exible joint
robot was addressed. Two control laws are proposed for the
task of trajectory tracking. Two nonlinear control schemes,
one model based and another one of discontinuous class were
selected to increase the performance of the classic schemes,
with the aim of avoiding oscillations on the robot arm tip.
State space dynamics description of exible joint is used in
order to design the nonlinear control schemes. By dynamic
feedback linearization methodology, the robot dynamics was
modied into a linear and controllable chain of integrators,
to be then controlled by a full state feedback control. In order
to reject nonlinearities in the state space description, while
avoiding oscillation effect in the exible joint robot arm, a
sliding mode control was proposed. The experimental results
show that the proposed nonlinear control laws, feedback
linearization and slide mode control, are efcient in achieving
precise moving of the robot if the dynamic model is exactly
know, but the performance of both controllers decrease when
unmodeled dynamics and disturbance are applied to the sys-
tem. To increase the robustness we implemented an integral
compensator for feedback linearization controller, in the same
way we introduce a integral compensator in the sliding man-
ifold. The experimental results show more efcient result
with bounded error, where slide mode control has the best
performance. An extension of the problem may consist in
the use of schemes based in compensator networks. Another
suggestion for further study consists in the use of Generalized
Proportional Integral Control.
